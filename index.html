  <p>I am a visual UX/UI Designer, Photographer and an Application/Web Developer from Phoenix, AZ but I have been living in Japan since 2010 where I worked mainly as an English teacher. Living in Japan has been a unique and interesting opportunity that has
    really helped me grow individually and better appreciate the world we all share. I love learning new things and am currently studying Python, Golang (Google Go), AI, Julia and photography. I have a professional background in web development and programming.
    I am moving back to the US in the fall of 2020 where I hope to apply my technical knowledge in a challenging and rewarding work experience. In my free time I enjoy designing art in Photoshop, playing video games and developing various applications
    for web and mobile devices. Got work for me? <a href="contact.html">Connect with me</a> and let’s get started on your next project.</p>
